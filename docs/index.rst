*GLASS* Extension Template
**************************

This is a template for `GLASS`__ extensions.  You can generate a new GitHub
project for your extension from the `repository`__.

A real extension would have some introductory text here.  It would probably
also use its own logo in the corner of the page.

.. note::

   There is an external link to the main *GLASS* documentation in the Table of
   Contents.  This is done for convenience in case someone finds the extension
   documentation but does not know what *GLASS* is.

   particularly if it contains just a single page.
